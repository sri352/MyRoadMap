to install in Ubuntu

apt-get isntall nginx

to install in centos or related distros

yum install epel-release

yum install nginx

service nginx start

ps aux | grep nginx to check if the nginx process has started

Installing through source code

nginx.org -> download

wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.19.6.tar.gz

tar -zxvf nginx-1.19.6.tar.gz 

cd nginx-1.19.6/

sudo apt-get install build-essential

sudo apt-get install libpcre3 libpcre3-dev zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev

./configure --sbin-path=/usr/bin/nginx --conf-path=/etc/nginx/nginx.conf --error-log-path=/var/log/nginx/error.log --http-log-path=/var/log/nginx/access.log --with-pcre --pid-path=/var/run/nginx.pid --with-http_ssl_module

make

make install


check the installation with (nginx -v) and check if the conf files etc have been created

nginx -h for the help

nginx -s stop for the stop signal

nginx -s reload for the reload signal

we will be using the same signals in the nginx.service file in the systemd conf


https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/systemd/ for adding the nginx to systemd more standardised way of starting and stopping services

change the paths in the file according to the paths in which you configured the above before install

systemctl start nginx
systemctl stop nginx
systemctl reload nginx


Once the master and the worker processes start you can see the nginx welcome page in the browser in localhost
