Two main configuration terms are directive and context

Directives are nothing but specific configuration options, which means they contain a name and value


Context is nothing but a scope has a nested scope etc

http {
    include       mime.types;

    server {
        listen       80;
        server_name  localhost;

        #charset koi8-r;

        #access_log  logs/host.access.log  main;

        location / {
            root   html;
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }

In the above example root, index, listen etc are directives, whereas server, http , location are the contexts.


The inner contexts inherit properties from the parent context.
