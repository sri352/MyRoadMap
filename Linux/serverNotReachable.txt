Obviously we start with the ping command

1) ping google.com

if you know the ip of the server you want to connect to

2) ping 142.250.71.24


if you don't know the ip of the server you are connecting to 

3) nslookup google.com

Name:	google.com
Address: 142.250.71.14
Name:	google.com
Address: 2404:6800:4007:806::200e


you should be getting a response as above with the resective url. 

If you didnt get the required ip your problem is with the dns resolution contact or change your dns settings for you domain name accordingly.

4) cat /etc/hosts

check the /etc/hosts file local for the local entry dns settings of the system if someone added a hardcoded value for the respective url

5) cat /etc/resolv.conf

this is the file where the ip of the configured dns server is stored. 

6) cat /etc/nsswitch.conf

checks the order in which the dns name resolution should take place.

For example:

the file will have a line saying this
hosts:  files dns

which means first it will check the corresponding ip in the files(/etc/hosts) file then if it doesnt find something then it will go to the dns server(/etc/resolv.conf) ip.

7)ifconfig

check if your system has an ip resolved 

8) netstat -rnv

check if you are able to ping the gateway, which should be available from the above command.

If this is not set there might be something wrong with the routing tables then you have configure them accordingly.



The above cases work fine if the server is down but what to do if the application it self is down

if pingable check if the application or service is down with certain port->  telnet ip port

telnet 142.250.71.14 443

443 for https and 80 for http 22 for ssh are the main things

is you get a message saying connected to the certain IP which says that the service running on the port is active 

if its not working may be the http,ssh or whatever service is not working

ps -ef <ServiceName>
