We always have  multiple versions of same thing, its always a hassle on how to manage it

update-alternatives providies a way it.

lets say you have both python2 and python3 installed, and based on some priority you want to used the selected one by python

you can install them using the sudo apt install python2 python3

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/python python /usr/bin/python2 20

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 30

you can add them to the new path in the usr/local/bin/python with the respective  paths to the original ones where 20 30 are the respective priorities to that 

you can look at the config of it from update-alternatives --query python, which shoukd give you an output like below

Name: python
Link: /usr/local/bin/python
Status: auto
Best: /usr/bin/python3
Value: /usr/bin/python3

Alternative: /usr/bin/python2
Priority: 20

Alternative: /usr/bin/python3
Priority: 30

when the status is auto the command or path with the highest priority is considered

You can switch between the auto and manual modes by using the sudo update-alternatives --config python

you can remove one of the update-alternatives using update-alternatives --remove python /usr/bin/python2

sudo update-alternatives --remove-all python to remove all the alternatives of it
