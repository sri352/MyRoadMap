There are various reasons when you are not able to connect to a remote server using ssh

1) telnet <ip> 22 (mostly)

first check wether the sshd is running on the server or not using the above command

ps -ef | grep sshd just info on how to check if sshd is running if someome is already logged into the server.

2) cat /etc/ssh/sshd_conf

this files contains the configuration of the sshd, on which port to run, etc.

It also contains a field PermitRootLogin which is mostly disabled on many servers for security purposes. Check if you are tyring to login as root.

cat /var/log/secure -> has all the logs on who is logging into the server including failed attempts etc  for fedora and similar distros.
cat /var/log/auth.log -> for deb distros.

check if there is a default shell assigned to the specific user in the /etc/passwd file.

all the accounts which have the /sbin/nologin wont be able to login too.


in prod and staging servers we always have a fixed no of login attempts that is achievable by the pam.d settings

you can read more about it in the following article o how to set it up, how to unlocked the locked user etc.

we have already used telnet in the previous and this article lets see what it does

telnet -> teletype network protocal

as we have used before we can check if the specific port is open or closed on the servers

you could say that telnet is as same as ssh but without the encryption

generally the telnet is configured on the port no 23

A good video explaining the same

Couldnt find any decent article stating how telnet checks if the port is open or not, If you find something please do contribute.
