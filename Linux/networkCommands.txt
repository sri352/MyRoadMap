INTERFACE CONFIGURATION FILES 

file-> /etc/nsswitch.conf -> tells the os where to the get the files of the configuration to the specific usecase

file-> /etc/hosts -> add the ip addess to the specific hostname etc for example localhost is defined in this file

directory-> /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts  -> contains the default configuration files for the Interfaces for example dhcp can be                                              removed in the Ifcfg-ensp03 and change the boot protocol to static ip here 

file-> /etc/resolv.conf  -> nameserver details for where to get the ipaddress of the specific hostname

NETWORK COMMANDS

ping -> check the connectivity or if the service is up or not

ifconfig -> get the configurations of the interfaces present on your system

netstat -rnv -> get the gateway and traffic flow details

tcpdump -i ensp03 -> traces every transaction that is coming and going out of the machine on a particular interface

wget <link to the file> -> will save the file in the pwd. eg: wget www.google.com -> saves the html file returned

curl to see if the page is up. ping to see if the server is up

curl www.google.com -> gets the html page  can use wget also same purpose

#########

FTP (file transfer protocol) 

-> on server

default port :21 
the server should be running the ftpd (deamon service for ftp)

includes various steps to install the ftp deamon service, start it, enable firewall for it etc

vi /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf  -> configuration file

 -> on client

yum install ftp

ftp <ipofserver>
enter username and password
bin
hash -> show progress
put <filename>
bye

##########

SCP (secure copy protocol)

copy file from one system to other with extra security and authentication

default SCP port = SSH default port :22

scp <file> <username>@<ip>:<destination folder>

############

rsync (Remote Synchronization)

utility to sync files by comparing the modification times and sizes

used for backup

faster than ftp and scp

default same as ssh :22

only transfers the changes in the file, doesnt transfer the unchanges part

yum install rsync (centos/redhat)
apt-get install rsync (ubuntu/debian)

rsync options source destination

rsync directory (local -> local) -> rsync -azvh /home/<username> /tmp/backups

rsync file (local -> remote) -> rsync -avz <filename> <username>@<ip>:<destination path>

rsync file (remote -> local) -> rsync -avzh <username>@<ip>:<server file path> <destination local path>


###########

System updates and repos

when you do yum install something first the os checks the /etc/yum.repos.d file for the url link to the repo

rpm (redhat package manager)

yum remove <packageName>

############

Two types of upgrades
1) Major version
2) Minor version 7.3 -> 7.4

minor update can be done using the yum command

yum update -y -> default y for all the questions

upgrade deletes the older package and install the new package

update preserves the older package in order for some application to works with the older version
